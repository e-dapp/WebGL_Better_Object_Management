### Simple WebGL mess-about initially based on "Learning WebGL" - Lesson 4
### Also using some methods from Lesson 9 for object management.

Learning WebGL's lesson page can be found [here](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?page_id=1217).

Lesson 9 [direct link](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=1008)

Also note this uses Brandon Jones' glMatrix for matrix and vector handling.

## This Project

Mostly for getting a feel of WebGL. Also just to make something that's pleasant to look at.

To run, just throw index.html into a WebGL supporting browser.
